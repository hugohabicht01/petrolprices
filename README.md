# Petrolprices
This is a little sideproject of mine, basically a vue 3 rewrite of [PetrolStationApp](https://github.com/hugohabicht01/PetrolStationApp).
It's a frontend which shows the current petrol prices for the different stations nearby you

*This only works inside Germany* due to the fact that the prices are fetched from https://creativecommons.tankerkoenig.de, which only has data from the MTK-S, a German federal agency
